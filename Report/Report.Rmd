# Introduction



# Literature review



# Hypotheses

*H1* Parties with common ideologies also show common keywords, emotional words and syntax.

*H2* Each party's keywords, emotional words and syntax change dramatically over time.


# Data

I used the R package `Tuber` to collect YouTube videos. `Tuber` consists of a number of functions useful to extract data from the YouTube platform via the YouTube Data API v3. I conducted the queries using each political party's ID in the `list_channel_videos` function, which resulted in obtaining metadata for each video published on every channel. The tool provided metadata for 20000 videos from [**Movimento 5 Stelle**](https://www.youtube.com/user/M5SParlamento)'s channel; 9548 videos from [**Lega Salvini Premier**](https://www.youtube.com/c/LegaSalviniPremier)'s channel; 1955 videos from [**Partito Democratico**](https://www.youtube.com/c/PartitoDemocratico)'s channel; 5555 videos from [**Fratelli d'Italia**](https://www.youtube.com/c/FratellidItaliaAN)'s channel; 67 videos from [**Forza Italia**](https://www.youtube.com/c/forzaitalia)'s channel.



# Methods

Since `Tuber`'s function to extract subtitles from YouTube videos has been recently disable, I used the R package `youtubecaptions` instead. The function `get_captions` gives back a number of string characters for each video, which correspond to the unique captions appearing on the screen as the video plays. I then joined them in single string characters, obtaining whole transciptions for each video of the channels.

After [preparing the data](https://github.com/DataAccess2020/YT-API/blob/main/Scripts/01_data_preparation.R) in order to have clean, tidy datasets for each political party's channel, I finally came to the content analysis.
