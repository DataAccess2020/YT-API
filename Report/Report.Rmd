# Introduction



# Literature review



# Hypotheses

*H1* Parties with common ideologies also show common keywords, emotional words and syntax.

*H2* Each party's keywords, emotional words and syntax change dramatically over time.


# Data

I used the R package `Tuber` to collect YouTube videos data. `Tuber` consists of a number of functions useful to extract data from the YouTube platform via the YouTube Data API v3. I conducted the queries using each political party's ID in the `list_channel_videos` function, which resulted in obtaining metadata for each video published on every channel. The tool provided metadata for 20000 videos from [**Movimento 5 Stelle**](https://www.youtube.com/user/M5SParlamento)'s channel; 9548 videos from [**Lega Salvini Premier**](https://www.youtube.com/c/LegaSalviniPremier)'s channel; 1955 videos from [**Partito Democratico**](https://www.youtube.com/c/PartitoDemocratico)'s channel; 5555 videos from [**Fratelli d'Italia**](https://www.youtube.com/c/FratellidItaliaAN)'s channel; 67 videos from [**Forza Italia**](https://www.youtube.com/c/forzaitalia)'s channel.

Since `Tuber`'s function to extract subtitles from YouTube videos has been recently disable, I used the R package `youtubecaptions` instead. The function `get_captions` gives back a number of string characters for each video, which correspond to the unique captions appearing on the screen as the video plays. I then joined them in single string characters, obtaining whole transcriptions for each video of the channels.



# Methods

After [_preparing the data_](https://github.com/DataAccess2020/YT-API/blob/main/Scripts/01_data_preparation.R) in order to have clean, tidy datasets for each political party's channel, I finally came to the analysis.

For each party's channel, I split the captions in words in order to remove stopwords (like conjunctions and auxiliary verbs, but also some adverbs that I manually added to the list), I removed encoding errors (like some accent marks) and some YouTube transcription errors (like numbers being transcripted with digits instead of words). When I finally ended up with clean lexemes of interest, for each party I obtained the `count` of each word and sorted them. To a first look, it appeared that the most frequent words were common between the parties: lavoro, partito and persone, to name a few.

At this point, I was ready to visualize the data. In order to look into my first hypothesis, I wanted to compare the frequency of words between parties. However, the number of videos uploaded by each party varies significantly: to make an example, the most recurrent word for Forza Italia is ***, which occurs 104 times in 60 videos, meanwhile the most recurrent word for Lega is ***, which occurs n in n videos. To make these numbers impartial and comparable, I decided to get the in-group percentage of occurrance of each word. For example, Forza Italia's *** percentage of appearance is 104/n, which is comparable to Lega's *** appearance of n/n.
